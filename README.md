# 📝 To Do List in Vanilla JS

A simple, minimalist "To Do List" application built **without frameworks or libraries** — only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JS**.

The goal of the project is to show how to implement a full-fledged interactive application using only the native capabilities of the browser.

## 📸 Design

The interface is taken from a free Figma template. It looks clean and clear:
